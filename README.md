# ⛑️ Helmet Detection Project

A rapid prototype built with Python and OpenCV to detect safety helmets in images. This project uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to perform real-time object detection.

## Problem Statement

In high-risk environments like construction sites or road traffic, failing to wear a safety helmet is a major cause of severe head injuries. This project aims to build a simple, automated system to detect the presence of helmets, providing a first step toward enforcing safety compliance.
