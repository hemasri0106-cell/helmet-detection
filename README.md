Project Overview:
This project uses YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) — a real-time object detection algorithm — to detect motorcyclists and check whether they are wearing helmets.
The system can automatically analyze road surveillance footage or traffic images to identify helmet violations, helping enhance traffic safety and law enforcement.

Objective
Detect motorbike riders using computer vision.
Identify whether the rider is wearing a helmet.
Mark or alert cases where no helmet is detected.
